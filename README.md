# bouncing-dvd-logo
Adjust the speed and color of the logo as it travels on it's journey across the screen. 
When changed from the default white logo, the color changes to a random RGB or HSB value every time it collides with the edge of the screen and changes direction.

### Setup instructions
To run the graphics, download the associated files (setup.html, bouncing_logo.js, and dvd_logo.png) and place them in the same directory.
Run the setup.html file in a Google Chrome window using the localhost. 
I usually use the VS Code "Live Server" extension to run setup.html in a live Google Chrome window.
